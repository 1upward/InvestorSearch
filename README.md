InvestorSearch
========
Collaboration with DreamIt Ventures -- This is a tool to find investors likely to be interested in your startup.

Overview
----
Search for investors who have invested in other companies and industries similar to yours.  Investors are sorted by number of matched search criteria, so that the best matches appear at the top. Create an account to save investors to your list. Do multiple searches and add and remove as many investors as you'd like to your list. Export them to a .csv file to keep track of outreach & share the list with your colleagues.
